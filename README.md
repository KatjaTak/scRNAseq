scRNAseq analysis for PhD thesis

To get better insides into gene expression network of early T−cell development, we analyzed publically available single cell RNA seq dataset, focusing on a thymic sample with enriched ETP, DN2 and DN3 thymocytes. Using Seurat package, we revealed 6 clusters corresponded to the stages of T-cell development. Stem cell−related and progenitor associated genes were downregulated by the end of DN2 stage, which is crucial for T-cell commitment. Previously, it was shown that LMO2 overexpression led to increased numbers of immature thymocytes in mice. Therefore, LMO2 overexpression might block T−cell development at the DN2 stage. On the other hand, T-cell specific genes were sequentially upregulated upon constant Notch signaling. The earliest candidate is Tcf7, which expression appeared at the ETP and DN1 stages. Hence, if Tcf7 expression would be downregulated, T-cell progenitors could not progress beyond the DN2 stage. In summary, we suggested two strategies to interfere with T-cell development: LMO2 overexpression and Tcf7 knockdown.
